# GPS vs CityPlay Accuracy Analysis

## Description
As a physicist and data scientist, I rely on data-driven insights, but I also believe in validating them through rigorous testing. When it comes to evaluating my child's football performance, I rely on **CityPlay by Playermaker**, a sensor-based tracking system, rather than subjective coach opinions. After all, football is a team sport, and coaches have multiple players to oversee. CityPlay provides detailed performance metrics by using **motion sensors placed on the player's feet**, tracking movement, speed, and ball interactions throughout training sessions and games.

## Aim
While CityPlay provides a wealth of stats, I was particularly curious about the **accuracy of its max speed estimation**. Since the sensors are placed on the feet and rely on accelerometers, the speed estimation might be influenced by each player's unique leg length and movement mechanics. I wanted to verify how precise the speed tracking is, considering these factors. To do this, I repurposed an old **ATP Mini Photo Finder**â€”a device I originally used for geotagging photos years ago. Since this device generates downloadable GPS logs, it was a natural candidate for this test.

However, there was a key limitation: while the **ATP manual claims a 1 Hz logging rate**, in reality, it logs at **0.1 Hz** (one data point every 10 seconds). This meant that to properly measure max speed, my child had to **run for at least 15 seconds along a straight path**. Additionally, I wanted to generate a **heat map** of football activity during practice and games.

To conduct the test, we went to a football field, equipped both sensors, and tracked the session. Due to the **low sampling rate of the GPS logger**, most **KPIs such as total distance, average speed, number of sprints, and acceleration measurements are unreliable**, but for speed verification, we selected a **straight-line sprint from the field to the parking lot** lasting over 10 seconds. The results were as follows:

- **Max Speed from GPS**: 19.87 km/h
- **Max Speed from CityPlay**: 20.3 km/h

Despite the limitations, the results suggest that CityPlay's speed estimation is quite accurate, with a deviation of approximately 0.43 km/h (2.16%) compared to the GPS measurement. This project serves as an exploration of **sensor-based performance tracking** and highlights both the strengths and limitations of different tracking technologies.

## Features
- Parses **GPS logs** (supports `.txt` and `.log` files with NMEA sentences).
- Extracts **key performance metrics**:
  - **Total distance covered**
  - **Total session time**
  - **Average speed**
  - **Max speed**
  - **Acceleration statistics**
  - **Number of sprints (speed >15.1 km/h)**
- Generates a **heatmap** to visualize speed distribution.
- Uses **Haversine formula** to calculate distance between GPS points.
- Converts timestamps to **Eastern Time (ET)** for better readability.

## Limitations
- **Low GPS logging rate (0.1 Hz)** may lead to gaps in data.
- Speed estimation accuracy **depends on GPS hardware and sampling rate**.
- Heatmap granularity is **limited by GPS data points**.
